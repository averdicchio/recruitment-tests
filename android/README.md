Please implement an app that fetches pictures from the Shutterstock API - http://api.shutterstock.com/ (documentation is here - https://developers.shutterstock.com/api/v2) - and displays them in a scrollable view.
You are complettely free in design choices.

Your main focus should be on a high performant app and try to test (unit/ui) everything thats feasible.
